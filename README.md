9. Key with names key1 and key2 should not pre-exist on the account.

## How to use

You can also choose to give the path to install the collection using -p as an option for this.
2. Once the collection has been installed, run the playbook located inside the collection /some/path/ansible_collections/prithviraj_singh/aws_kubernetes/ named as playbook.yml. To run the playbook you can use the command:
    ansible-playbook /path/to/playbook/playbook.yml
3. Once the playbook has ran successfully, you can check out the AWS instances that have been spawned over ap-south-1.
4. Connect to the instance named as master, login as ec2-user, use the command:
    kubectl get nodes
    #prints all the nodes, including master
That's it!!!

### Additionally:-
you can change the attributes of the cluster by changing the variable located inside /some/path/ansible_collections/prithviraj_singh/aws_kubernetes/roles/aws_instances/vars/main.yml, /some/path/ansible_collections/prithviraj_singh/aws_kubernetes/roles/worker_nodes/vars/main.yml and /some/path/ansible_collections/prithviraj_singh/aws_kubernetes/roles/kubernetes_role/vars/main.yml
### Note:-
If you wish to change the EC2‚Äôs image, make sure to change the username for initial login to the provided user inside ansible_collection/prithvi_singh/aws_kubrnetes/playbook.yml . Also, creating a master-node with RHEL-8 image doesn‚Äôt work (somehow, if you know the reason and fix for it please let me know).
